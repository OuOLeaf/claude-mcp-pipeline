In February 2025, I developed a new AI applications pipeline, Claude + MCP. This has saved me 20% of my daily workflow in data analysis.

**Here are the questions I'm interested in answering:**
1. Why do we need to ask, copy, and paste code into other tools just to test if the code works?
2. What does next-generation analysis look like?
3. How can we develop our own AI agent?

**I took the following steps to create my AI agent:**
1. Downloaded Claude MCP and SQLite
2. Modified claude_desktop_config.json
3. Set up my agent's functions in a JSON file

**Here is my demo:**
1. Data Analysis – No need to use SQL or Excel to generate plots

2. Filesystem – Files are moved and renamed through AI communication

Claude MCP helps streamline the workflow and saves us time, allowing us to focus on the structure of analysis.
